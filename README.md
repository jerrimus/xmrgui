XMGUI is a simple graphic shell, you enter your data, it creates a config file for you and launches the miner using the config.
Our current back ends are the  [xmr-stak  miner](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) and the [nice hash equihash miner](https://github.com/nicehash/nheqminer)
 
   XMGUI currently mines Aeon, Bytecoin, Bipcoin, Bitcoal, Monero, Sumokoin,Ultranote, and Zcash.
