Xmrgui is a simple graphic shell, you enter your data, it creates a config file for you and launches the miner using the config
The miner xmrgui uses currently is the excellent xmr-stak-cpu miner.  More info at the [release post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneroMining/comments/7gbfsh/xmrgui_super_alpha_release/) on reddit.

        This is an initial public release, the software may have some issues, but appeared to be fully cunctional in my testing
It's currently written in vb.net. If you wish to compile yourself, grab a free copy of vs2010 exprress, it is sufficient to build.


[Binary is here](https://github.com/jerrimus/xmrgui/blob/master/xmrgui/xmrgui/bin/Release/xmrgui.exe)
 The miner can [be found here](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases) . 
  
  Installation consists of dropping the xmrgui.exe into your xmr-stak directory and running it.
